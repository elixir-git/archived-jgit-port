# Some Comments on Porting from Jgit

This project is a port of [jgit](https://www.eclipse.org/jgit/), which is an all-Java implementation of git.

While I've chosen to follow many of the design patterns present in jgit, in my opinion, it's far more important that this project feel comfortably at home in the Elixir ecosystem. In this file, I document some of the porting design decisions that I've made, especially where they differ from jgit.

## String Buffers -> Charlists

The jgit APIs often speak in byte arrays with offset (pointers). In xgit, we instead pass around charlists. Since a charlist is a singly-linked list, we pass around updated charlist references without offset parameters because it is conceptually easier (and more performant) to do so.

## Localization

jgit has its own localization mechanism (see class `JGitText`). I've decided not to port that mechanism, but rather to use the Elixir module [`gettext`](https://github.com/elixir-lang/gettext). Unlike jgit, we do not localize internal exception messages, only the publicly-facing interface.

## Exceptions -> Errors

In keeping with Elixir convention, jgit class names that end with `Exception` are renamed to Elixir modules that end with `Error`.

## Listeners

Instead of porting the `Listener` and `ListenerList` mechanism from jgit, we use [`pg2`](http://erlang.org/doc/man/pg2.html) to manage inter-process messaging and the related lifetime issues.

## Windows OS Support

In this initial (experimental) version of xgit, I've decided not to explicitly support Windows. This lets me avoid the time that would be spent porting some of jgit's abstractions. Instead, we'll rely as much as possible on the Erlang VM. Some of the abstractions explicitly avoided:

* `FS` (file system)

I recognize that retrofitting these abstractions into the system later will be at best, difficult, but I can't justify the cost in porting them for my purposes here.

## Units of time

Elixir doesn't have an exact analogue for Java's [`java.time.Duration`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/Duration.html) or [`java.time.Instant`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/Instant.html). Rather than inventing new abstractions, we'll follow Elixir/Erlang conventions and port as follows:

* `java.time.Duration` is ported as a tuple of `{count, time_unit}` where `time_unit` is as defined by the [`System.time_unit` type](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/System.html#t:time_unit/0).
* `java.time.Instant` is ported as an integer result of [`System.os_time(:microsecond)`](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/System.html#os_time/1). We do not support nanosecond-level accuracy. (I could not find any call for nanosecond accuracy in jgit.)

## OS current working directory not used

Unlike jgit, xgit never defaults to the current working directory. (Any search of the source code for `File.cwd/0` or `File.cwd!/0` should return no results.) Given the primarily server-based focus of xgit, it seems better to require an explicit specification of where the repo is located.

Similarly, xgit should not use the launch-point for the Elixir application as a default directory for git repositories. (Specifically, we do not port the Java property `user.dir` or the equivalent constant `Constants.OS_USER_DIR`.)

## Tracking jgit `master` branch

The xgit project tracks the `master` branch of jgit. In order to avoid missing changes as they are introduced to jgit, this project observes the following two policies:

* We always port from a specific commit in the jgit repository. This commit ID and commit log are recorded below.

* Periodically, we advance that commit to the latest commit in `master` branch. All changes in jgit between old and new commit are inspected and those changes are reapplied to xgit as appropriate. (Code that has not yet been ported remains ignored in this transition.)

The current jgit tracking commit is:

    tree:<depth>: do not revisit tree during packing

    If a tree is visited during pack and filtered out with tree:<depth>, we
    may need to include it if it is visited again at a lower depth.

    Until now we revisit it no matter what the depth is. Now, avoid
    visiting it if it has been visited at a lower or equal depth.

## Tracking ported code

Any code that is ported from jgit must:

* Include, verbatim, the copyright notice at the top of the corresponding jgit file. (You may add yourself as an additional contributor.)
* Include a note citing the path in the jgit repository of the file that has been ported.
