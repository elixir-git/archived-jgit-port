defmodule Xgit.RevWalk do
  @moduledoc ~S"""
  Walks a commit graph and produces the matching commits in order.

  A `RevWalk` instance can only be used once to generate results. Running a
  second time requires creating a new `RevWalk` instance, or invoking
  `reset/1` before starting again. Resetting an existing instance may be
  faster for some applications as commit body parsing can be avoided on the
  later invocations.

  `RevWalk` instances are not thread-safe. Applications must either restrict
  usage of a `RevWalk` instance to a single thread, or implement their own
  synchronization at a higher level.

  TO DO: Verify that claim. Might not fit for Xgit.

  Multiple simultaneous `RevWalk` instances per `Repository` are permitted, even
  from concurrent threads. Equality of `RevCommit`s from two different `RevWalk`
  instances is never true, even if their object IDs are equal (and thus they
  describe the same commit).

  TO DO: Update language to fit Enumerable:
  The offered iterator is over the list of `RevCommit`s described by the
  configuration of this instance. Applications should restrict themselves to
  using either the provided Iterator or {@link #next()}, but never use both on
  the same RevWalk at the same time. The Iterator may buffer RevCommits, while
  {@link #next()} does not.
