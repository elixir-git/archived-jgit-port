defmodule Xgit.Lib.ObjectReader do

  Reads an `ObjectDatabase` for a single process.

  Readers that can support efficient reuse of pack encoded objects should also
  implement the companion protocol `ObjectReuseAsIs`.

  PORTING NOTE: Is this necessarily tied to a single process in Elixir?

  PORTING NOTE: `ObjectReuseAsIs` is not yet ported.

  PORTING NOTE: `streamFileThreadhold` is considered an implementation detail
  and thus is not part of the generic interface.

  PORTING NOTE: This jgit class is partially ported for now. Holding off on the
  rest until I understand the use cases better.

    Resolve an abbreviated `ObjectId` to its full form.

    This method searches for an `ObjectId` that begins with the abbreviation,
    and returns at least some matching candidates.

    If the returned collection is empty, no objects start with this
    abbreviation. The abbreviation doesn't belong to this repository, or the
    repository lacks the necessary objects to complete it.

    If the collection contains exactly one member, the abbreviation is
    (currently) unique within this database. There is a reasonably high
    probability that the returned ID is what was previously abbreviated.

    If the collection contains 2 or more members, the abbreviation is not
    unique. In this case the implementation is only required to return at
    least 2 candidates to signal the abbreviation has conflicts. User- friendly
    implementations should return as many candidates as reasonably possible,
    as the caller may be able to disambiguate further based on context. However,
    since databases can be very large (e.g. 10 million objects) returning 625,000
    candidates for the abbreviation "0" is simply unreasonable. Implementers
    should draw the line at around 256 matches.

  Obtain a unique abbreviation (prefix) of an object SHA-1.

  This function offers a reasonable default (7) for the minimum length. Callers who
  don't care about the minimum length should use the default.

  Abbreviates the ID to the specified length, then resolves it to see if there
  are multiple results. When multiple results are found, the length is extended
  by 1 and resolve is tried again.

  The returned abbreviation would expand back to the argument `object_id` when
  passed to `resolve/2`, assuming no new objects are added to this repository
  between calls.
