  Objects stored with this type actually have a different type which must

  An offset delta uses a negative offset from the start of this object to
  refer to its delta base. The base object must exist in this packfile
  (even in the case of a thin pack).

  A reference delta uses a full object id (hash) to reference the delta
  base. The base object is allowed to be omitted from the packfile, but
