  Protocol that allows for different storage representations of git objects.

  Get in-pack object type.

  Get the size of the object in bytes.

  @doc ~S"""
  Return `true` if this object is too large to obtain as a byte array.

  If so, the caller should use a stream returned by `open_stream/1` to
  prevent overflowing the VM heap.

  Obtain the (possibly cached) bytes of this object.

  This function offers direct access to the internal caches, potentially
  saving on data copies between the internal cache and higher level code.

  Obtain an `Enumerable` (typically a stream) to read this object's data.

  # PORTING NOTE: It is expected that the `copyTo` function in jgit's ObjectLoader
  # class can be mimiced by using `Stream.into/1`, so it's unnecessary to port it.
