defmodule Xgit.Util.GenServerUtils do

  Some utilities to make error handling in GenServer calls easier.

  Xgit is somewhat more exception-friendly than typical Elixir code
  """

  @doc ~S"""
  Makes a synchronous call to the server and waits for its reply.

  If the response is `:ok`, return `server` (for function chaining).

  If the response is `{:ok, (value)}`, return `value`.

  If the response is `{:error, (reason)}`, raise `reason` as an error.

  Delegate a `handle_call/3` call to a `handle_(something)` call on a module.
