defmodule Xgit.Util.TupleUtils do

  Some utilities for working with Elixir tuples.

  @doc ~S"""
  Binary-search a tuple (which must be sorted) for a specific value.

  This function returns the index of the specified value if it is contained in the tuple.
  If the value does not exist in the tuple, it returns `-(insertion point + 1)`.

  The insertion point is defined as the point at which the value would be inserted
  into the tuple; in other words, the index of the first element in the tuple
  greater than the key, or `tuple_size(tuple)` if all elements in the tuple are
  less than the specified key.

  This function is intended to match the semantics of Java's `Arrays.binarySearch`
  method.
